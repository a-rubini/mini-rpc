@top Introduction

This is a mini remote procedure call, but I called it IPC in error.
The short name throughout the project is @code{minipc}, used both as
a prefix for exported symbols and header/library name.

It is currently being suggested as a replacement for what we have in the
@i{White Rabbit} system, because the way it is there is not portable
(assembly code and knowledge of the ABI is required for each
platform).  Nonetheless, I borrowed quite some ideas from the
implementation by Tomasz Wlostowski, who must definitely be
considered co-author and my inspiring muse.

@node Basic Ideas
@chapter Basic Ideas

The package is meant to be as simple as possible, while still having
some abstraction to be useable on different environments than the
@i{White Rabbit Switch}.  There are other RPC environments, but they are
usually oversized for our needs. Besides, I personally love small
things that I can use as completely-understandable examples when
teaching.

With this library, a process can be a server, or a client, or both.
A server program opens a Unix domain socket (or other communication channels)
and then accepts client programs. Thus,
performing a server action means either accepting a new client or
performing a client request.  To avoid requiring the library
to be the only I/O of the process, I export the @i{fd_set} structure
that lists the file descriptors that are active in the server (I don't directly
support @code{poll(2)}, only @code{select(2)}).

A client program only works on a single file descriptor, so the library
provides a function to retrieve the fd (thus you can use poll yourself).

A function being exported is defined by a data structure, which lists both
the argument list and the return value.  Data types supported are
integers, double-precision floating point numbers,
strings and generic structures.  We might (or might
not) export the thing over TCP and add endian conversion, but at this
point the data type is really just informative.

An argument list is described by a zero-terminated array of 32-bit
integers, which specifies both the type and the size of the argument
being passed.  The return value is described by a single 32-bit
integer specifying type and size.  The @code{minipc.h} header provides
macros to build the actual values.


@c ##########################################################################
@node The Main Data Structure
@chapter The Main Data Structure

In order to communicate, client and server must agree on the functions
being called remotely.  In the library, a function is identified by a
string name, 18 bytes at most.

Following is the "procedure definition" structure, from @code{minipc.h}.
Its length (on 32-bit machines) is 36 bytes if the function takes
no arguments, each argument is described by 4 more bytes.

@example
   struct minipc_pd {
           minipc_f *f;        /* pointer to the function */
           char name[20];      /* name of the function */
           uint32_t flags;
           uint32_t retval;    /* type of return value */
           uint32_t args[];    /* null-terminated list of arguments */
   };
@end example

Client and server are expected to share such data structure, or at least
the macros used to build the data structure. The fields
@i{name}, @i{retval} and @i{args}, must match. The function pointer
is only used in the server. No
user-accessible flags are currently there.

The "args" array must be terminated by a "MINIPC_ARG_END" value, which
is guaranteed to be bitwise zero. The other arguments encode type and
size, even if some types (like integers, floats) always have the same
size. The header offers the following macros to encode and decode
the arguments (and retval). Please look at the examples to better
get the feeling of the code.

@table @code
@item MINIPC_ARG_ENCODE(atype, type)

	The macro returns a 32-bit integer that includes the argument
        type (see below for a list of @i{atypes}) and the size of @i{type}
        (using @code{sizeof} internally).  The size must be 64kB at most.

@item MINIPC_GET_ATYPE(word)
@itemx MINIPC_GET_ASIZE(word)

	The functions return the type and size of an argument.

@item MINIPC_ARG_END

	This is zero, the terminator for the argument list.

@end table

The supported types are the values of this enumeration (the error
special type is used internally by the library):

@example
   enum minipc_at {
           MINIPC_ATYPE_ERROR = 0xffff,
           MINIPC_ATYPE_NONE = 0,  /* used as terminator */
           MINIPC_ATYPE_INT = 1,
           MINIPC_ATYPE_INT64,
           MINIPC_ATYPE_DOUBLE,    /* float is promoted to double */
           MINIPC_ATYPE_STRING,    /* size  is strlen() each time */
           MINIPC_ATYPE_STRUCT
   };
@end example

@c ##########################################################################
@node The Client
@chapter The Client

A process acting as a @i{minipc} client creates a client channel. The
@code{minipc_ch} structure includes a file descriptor that you can
retrieve. The following functions are thus available:

@example
   struct minipc_ch *minipc_client_create(const char *name, int flags);
   int minipc_fileno(struct minipc_ch *ch);
@end example

The name used to create a channel is a filename including no
path separators and no colon (@code{:}) character.

The library currently only supports Unix domain sockets, and the
filename is used to connect to a socket in the @code{MINIPC_BASE_PATH}
directory (default value: @code{/tmp/.minipc}). Other channels will
use colon-separated names, for example @code{TCP:@i{host}:@i{port}}
for TCP channels.

With the fileno a client may poll for reading, although this is not
usually needed because the server will only send reply packets:
exactly one reply packet for each request packet.

A client can make a request by calling this function:

@example
   int minipc_call(struct minipc_ch *ch, int millisec_timeout,
                   const struct minipc_pd *pd, void *ret, ...);
@end example

The arguments are passed as a list of values (structures and strings
are passed by pointer); the return pointer is filled with the returned
data item (please look at the examples for actual use patterns).

The @code{minipc_call} function picks data from the variable arguments
according to the argument types set forth in the "pd" procedure
definition.  Similarly, the return value is stored where pointed by
ret, according to pd->retval.  Note that the return value must be at least
4 bytes long.

The @code{minipc_call} returns 0 on success and -1 on failure, setting
@code{errno} accordingly..  If @i{send}, @i{poll} or @i{recv} return
an error, the original @code{errno} is preserved.  If @i{poll} times
out (using the provided timeout) @code{errno} is set to
@code{ETIMEDOUT}.  If the server returns an error (using
@code{MINIPC_ATYPE_ERROR}), the local errno is set to @code{EREMOTEIO}
and the remote one is saved using the retval pointer (which is
guaranteer to point to an int-sized or bigger area).

To close the connection, a client can call

@example
   int minipc_close(struct minipc_ch *ch);
@end example

@c ##########################################################################
@node The Server
@chapter The Server

The server must open a server channel and process requests as needed.
The library exports the following functions for server use:

@example
   struct minipc_ch *minipc_server_create(const char *name, int flags);

   int minipc_export(struct minipc_ch *ch, const struct minipc_pd *pd);
   int minipc_unexport(struct minipc_ch *ch, const struct minipc_pd *pd);

   int minipc_server_action(struct minipc_ch *ch, int timeoutms);

   int minipc_server_get_fdset(struct minipc_ch *ch, fd_set *setptr);
@end example

The @i{export} and @i{unexport} functions should be self-explicative. Note
that the exported function name is part of the @code{pd} structure.
The @code{pd} passed to @i{minipc_unexport} must be the
same as the one passed to @i{minipc_export}, not just a pointer to a
data structure with the same contents.

The function @i{minipc_server_action} either accepts a new client or
handles all pending client requests.  For every packet received from a
client, the function send back a reply packet.  So, even if communication is
based on @code{SOCK_STREAM}, packet boundaries are preserved by using only
synchronous communication.

The @i{minipc_get_fdset} function returns an @i{fdset} structure, so the caller
may use select() in the main loop by augmenting the minipc @i{fdset}
with its own.

Internally, the server action calls @i{poll} by itself (with the
specified timeout). Thus, if you already used @i{select} you can pass
0 as @code{timeoutms} in minipc_server_action.

The header uses a @code{typedef} for exported functions, to ease their
definition:

@example
   typedef int (minipc_f)(const struct minipc_pd *,
                          void *retval, void *args);
@end example

An exported function receives a pointer to its own description, a
pointer to the data being returned  and a pointer to
the unmarshalled arguments (again, please look at the examples)

The function itself should pick up data from the pointers. Such
pointers are usually directed to the packet buffer, so you should not
change the arguments themselves before calling the real function with
the ABI of the current CPU.

For example, the code exporting @code{sqrt} looks like the following:

@example
   extern double sqrt(double x);

   int export_sqrt(const struct minipc_pd *pd, uint32_t *args, void *ret)
   {
           double in, out;

           in = *(double *)args;
           out = sqrt(in);
           *(double *)retval = out;
           return 0;
    }

    struct minipc_pd sqrt_pd = {
            .f = export_sqrt,
            .id.s = "sqrt",
            .retval = MINIPC_ARG_ENCODE(MINIPC_AT_DOUBLE, double),
            .args = {
                    MINIPC_ARG_ENCODE(MINIPC_AT_DOUBLE, double),
                    MINIPC_ARG_END,
            },
   }
@end example

Please note that while using doubles or integers is easy, unmarshalling
a string from the args array is not trivial. The library
offers a generic unmarshall function:

@example
    uint32_t *minipc_get_next_arg(uint32_t arg[], uint32_t atype);
@end example

The function receives the current pointer to an argument and the
current type.  The function offers a portable solution to the
problem of strings or structure whose size is not a multiple of
4 bytes.

This is an example use of the function:

@example
   int export_strcat(const struct minipc_pd *pd, uint32_t *args, void *ret)
   {
           char *s1, char *s2, char sout[256];

           s1 = (char *)args;
           args = minipc_get_next_arg(args, pd->args[0]);
           s2 = (char *)args;

           strncpy(sout, s1, sizeof(sout));
           strncat(sout, s2, sizeof(sout) - strlen(sout));
           strncpy(ret, sout, MINIPC_MAX_REPLY));
           return 0;
   }
@end example

The client that calls a server exporting @i{sqrt} (as shown above)
will do it in the following way. The code assumes
@code{struct minipc_ch *client} and @code{struct minipc_pd pd_sqrt}
are valid variables:

@example
   double operand;
   double result;
   int error;

   error = minipc_call(client, &pd_sqrt, &result, operand);
   if (error < 0) { ... }
@end example

@c ##########################################################################
@node Diagnostics
@chapter Diagnostics

A @code{minipc_ch} channel may have an associated log file (you can
use stderr or whatever). This following function sets the log file:

@example
   int minipc_set_logfile(struct minipc_ch *ch, FILE *logf);
@end example

You can set the logfile to NULL (default at channel creation) if you
want to stop sending diagnostics. The function does not open or close
the file, as otherwise it wouldn't be possible to use stderr, so if
you want to open a log file on disk, it's your duty to do so; in this
case you possibly want to make it unbuffered, since the library only
calls @i{fprintf} on it, with no explicit @i{fflush}.

@c ##########################################################################
@node The Communication Protocol
@chapter The Communication Protocol

The protocol itself is an internal detail, but worth knowing in case a
bug is discovered. Relevant structures are defined in the internal header
@code{minipc-int.h}.

Request packets are sent as @code{struct mpc_req_packet}, which
includes the following items:

@itemize @bullet
@item 20 bytes for the function name, copied from "pd" structure
@item an array of 32-bit integers for the arguments.
@end itemize

Each argument passed to the remote function is stored into one or
more such 32-bit integers, in host byte order. Note that the
actual size of the argument is written in the "pd" args list.
Marshalling is performed by minipc_call() with @i{varargs} evaluation.

Reply packets are sent as @code{struct mpc_rep_packet}", which has two fields:

@itemize @bullet
@item @code{uint32_t type}
@item @code{uint8_t val[]}
@end itemize

The type is checked to be the same as what is defined as "ret" in the
@code{pd} structure. The @code{val} array is a plain byte array that
is copied to the @code{ret} pointer passed to minipc_call (like
@i{result} in the sqrt example above). When @code{type} is an error
value (i.e. @code{MINIPC_ATYPE_ERROR}) the payload is a 4-byte errno
value.  Note that @code{type} is not passed back to the caller of
@i{minipc_call}, because errors are identified by a negative return value.

@c ##########################################################################
@node Transport Mechanisms
@chapter Transport Mechanisms

The @i{name} argument used in either @i{minipc_server_create} or
@i{minipc_client_create} is used to select both the back-end transport
and instance.  At this point in time, the library supports the
following back-ends for communication:

@table @i

@item Unix sockets

	The default transport for communication is Unix-domain sockets
	(@code{PF_UNIX} a.k.a. @code{PF_FILE} or @code{PF_LOCAL}).  The
	@i{name} argument is used as socket name within the default
        directory for @i{mini-ipc} sockets. A server can
	handle many clients at a time in a single thread, based on @i{select}.

@item System-V Shared memory

	If the @i{name} argument is of the form @code{shm:<id>}, then
        the transport being used is a shared memory area. The @i{id}
        is either a decimal oh hex number. In this case a server can only
        accept one client, because there is no check for concurrency. Please
        note that the library doesn't enforce this, so more clients may
        be used if you make your own locking.  @i{mini-ipc} places its
        data structures at the beginning of the shared memory area.

@item I/O memory

	If the @i{name} argument is of the form @code{mem:<address>},
        The library will open @i{/dev/mem} and use the specific address
        as communication transport.  The address must be a multiple
        of page size. This is meant to communicate with
        a coprocessor living on and FPGA (this is one of the use cases
        in the @i{White Rabbit Switch}).  Again, both server and client
        operation is supported, but a server should accept only one client
        at a time.

@end table

Since the library is based on file descriptors, the two memory-based
transports fork a process that polls the memory area to signal
events on the @code{minipc_ch} file descriptor.  The default polling
interval is 10ms, but it can be changed by calling @i{minipc_set_poll}
before creating the channel:

@example
   int minipc_set_poll(int usec);
@end example

The function returns the previous polling interval, in microseconds,
or -1 with @code{errno} set to @code{-EINVAL} if the argument is
negative or zero. Please note that the polling interval must be set
before creating the channel, because the parameter will be used by the
child process.

@c ##########################################################################
@node Examples
@chapter Examples

The subdirectory @code{examples/} hosts a number of examples, that
are logically divided in groups.

@menu
* Trivial Example::             
* Pty-based Example::           
* A Bridge to Shared Memory::   
* Native Shared Memory::        
@end menu

@c ==========================================================================
@node Trivial Example
@section Trivial Example

The two programs in this group are called @code{trivial-server} and
@code{trivial-client}. 

The server exports three functions:

@table @i
@item sum
The function receives two integers and returns another integer value.

@item gettimeofday
The function receives nothing and returns @code{struct timeval}.

@item sqrt
The functions receives one @code{double} number and returns another.
@end table

The server program shows how the @code{minipc_pd} structures are built
and how the @o{minipc_f} function is implemented.  For each exported
function, the source file includes first the non-rpc-aware function
and then the mini-ipc wrapper.

In this case the main loop of the server just calls the server action,
without doing anything else. It is verbose in its own, and
declares @i{stderr} as @code{logfile} for the library.

The client declares the same @code{minipc_pd} structures as the server.
In more serious uses you should define the structure in a separate
source file, in order to share them in the server and client.
The client just calls the server functions a few times, delaying
half a second in between.

The following commands, run in two different terminal sessions,
can be used to test the pair of programs:

@example
    ./trivial-server

    for n in $(seq 1 20); do
        ./trivial-client &
	 sleep 0.2
    done
@end example

@c ==========================================================================
@node Pty-based Example
@section Pty-based Example

This set of programs sets up a more complete example.  It shows how to
multiplex RPC operations and other activities by using th RPC @i{fd_set}
together with your own channels. The programs are called @code{pty-server}
and @code{pty-client}.

The server creates a pseudo-tty device and spawn a shell running in it.
If then feeds its own @i{stdin} to the shell and the shell's @i{stdout} to
its own @i{stdout}.  You should call it with no arguments. Its log file
is called @code{/tmp/pty-server.XXXXXX}, with @code{XXXXXX} replaced
by some unique string by the @i{mkstemp} library function.

The RPC client can make queries to this server, without disturbing the
operation of the underlying shell.  The client can ask for the
statistics of bytes read/written to/from the @i{pty} device; it can
read or write environment variables in the @code{pty-server}
application; it can feed strings to the shell driven by the pty
server; it can run strlen and strcat remotely, as well as remotely run
the stat system call (to check string and structure exchange).  Each
@code{pty-client} run takes a command line, like the following ones
(names in angle-brackets are place holders):

@example
   ./pty-client count
   ./pty-client getenv <name>
   ./pty-client setenv <name> <value>
   ./pty-client feed <shell-command>
   ./pty-client strlen <string>
   ./pty-client strcat <string> <string>
   ./pty-client stat <filename>
@end example

The commands @code{count}, @code{feed}, @code{strlen}, @code{strcat}
and @code{stat} can be verified by just inspecting their own output. The
commands @code{setenv} and @code{getenv} may cross-verified.

Note that only one pty-server can be running at a time (as the rpc
socket is a static name within the socket directory), but you can run
several clients at the same time.

The sharing of @code{minipc_pd} (procedure description) in this set of
example is accomplished by linking the same object file in both
programs, to avoid code duplication.

@c ==========================================================================
@node A Bridge to Shared Memory
@section A Bridge to Shared Memory

This set of examples shows how to write a @i{bridge} from @i{mini-ipc}
to other communications media.  Moreover, it shows how a single
process can act both as a client and a server.

The example example shows how to route @i{mini-ipc} requests to
another process through shared memory.  Sure there is no real interest
in shared memory for IPC calls, but the same approach can be used with
mailbox-kind communication mechanisms to talk with hardware; for
example a CPU without OS running on an FPGA. That's why the examples
in this set are called @code{mbox-@i{something}}.

Please note that @i{mini-ipc} now has shared memory support: this set
of example doesn't use the library internals but implements a simpler
protocol.

This example-set is made up of three programs:

@table @code
@item mbox-bridge
	The process acts as both a server and a client of the @i{mini-ipc}
        protocol, routing requests to and from a shared-memory mailbox.
        As @i{mini-ipc} client, it requests the current time to
	@code{trivial-server} (such queries are originated from the shared
        memory area).  As @i{mini-ipc} server, it replies to
        @i{stat} calls for local filenames (and such service is asked
        to another process through the shared memory).

@item mbox-process
	The "remote" process. It only communicating though
        the mailbox device.  It asks for the current time once a
        second and can serve @i{stat} requests when they happen.

@item mbox-client
	A program that reads @i{stdin} forever, asking a @i{stat}
        system call for every line it reads (such @i{stat} is asked
        to @code{mbox-bridge} using @i{mini-ipc}.
@end table

To demonstrate the mechanism, you'll need to run @code{trivial-server}
(which answers @i{timeofday} queries), @code{mbox-bridge} (to bridge
requests), @code{mbox-process} and one or more @code{mbox-client}
processes.

The following is an example out output generated by @code{mbox-bridge}
(which passes @i{gettimeofday} requests silently as a @i{mini-ipc}
client, but uses @i{mini-ipc} verbose logging to @i{stderr} as a server).
The server in the fragment below is being contacted by several clients,
some of which close the connection:

@example
    minipc_export: exported 0x8a3d228 (stat) with pd 0x804a1a0
                    -- retval 00050058, args 00040004...
    mpc_handle_connection: accept returned fd 5 (error 0)
    mpc_handle_client: request for stat
    mpc_handle_client: request for stat
    mpc_handle_client: request for stat
    mpc_handle_client: error 0 in fd 5, closing
    mpc_handle_connection: accept returned fd 5 (error 0)
    mpc_handle_client: request for stat
    mpc_handle_client: request for stat
    mpc_handle_client: error 0 in fd 5, closing
    mpc_handle_connection: accept returned fd 5 (error 0)
    mpc_handle_connection: accept returned fd 6 (error 0)
    mpc_handle_client: request for stat
    mpc_handle_client: error 0 in fd 6, closing
@end example

The following fragment shows the output of an @code{mbox-process},
which reports all actions (it asks the time and serves @i{stat}
queries):

@example
   time: 1326231447.212400
   time: 1326231448.218001
   time: 1326231449.233714
   Serving stat(/home/rubini)
   time: 1326231450.240125
@end example

Finally, the following fragment shows the input line (first line)
and output lines reported by one invocation of @code{mbox-client}:

@example
   /home/rubini
   minipc_call: calling "stat"
   /home/rubini:
   mode 40755, size 32768, owner 410, atime 1326230999
@end example

@c ==========================================================================
@node Native Shared Memory
@section Native Shared Memory

This set of examples uses the native shared memory support in the
library.  This means that server code exports functions using the
library data structures, and the client calls them in the same way.

There are two examples in this set, that share the source file that
instantiates function definitions. The code, as you may expect, is
mainly copied from the @i{pty} set of examples described earlier. I
see no point in factorizing stuff here, as the example must be
understandable by themselves.

@table @code

@item shmem-server

	The program creates a server using a name @code{shm:@i{XXXX}} where
        the @i{XXXX} is received from the command line.
        For example ``@code{./shmem-server 45}''. It uses verbose reporting
        on @i{stderr} and just waits for requests.

@item shmem-client

	The program receives several command line arguments: the first
        is the shared memory identifier, that should match the one used
        in the server. Further arguments are commands. The client
        supports the following commands, that access all functions
        exported by the server. Each of them receives 1 or 2 arguments:
        @i{getenv}, @i{setenv}, @i{add}, @i{strlen}, @i{strcat}, @i{stat}.

@end table

This is a sample client session, with diagnostic stripped:

@example
   $ ./shmem-client 45 getenv USER
   getenv(USER) = rubini
   $ ./shmem-client 45 setenv USER pippo
   setenv USER = pippo : success
   $ ./shmem-client 45 getenv USER
   getenv(USER) = pippo
   $ ./shmem-client 45 strlen "this is a test"
   strlen(this is a test) = 14
   $ ./shmem-client 45 add 666 999
   add 666 + 999 = 1665 : success
@end example

At the same time, the server reported the following:

@example
   mpc_handle_client: request for getenv
   mpc_handle_client: request for setenv
   mpc_handle_client: request for getenv
   mpc_handle_client: request for strlen
   mpc_handle_client: request for add
@end example

Remote errors are handled as usual: @code{EREMOTEIO} locally and the
proper @code{errno} value in the packet:

@example
   $ ./shmem-client 45 stat /tmp/nosuchfile
   minipc_call: remote error "No such file or directory"
   .//shmem-client: remote "stat": Remote I/O error
@end example

@chapter Bugs

Please note that there are a number of untested corner cases as I write this.
There are no known bugs, but the following points at least may be
problematic as I didn't thoroughly test the code for them:

@itemize @bullet

@item There are some hard limits, like less than 64 file descriptors
      open. The thing is meant to remain small and avoid some complexity.

@item Again, for simplicity, not everything is undone properly; but for
      small systems with a well defined process-set this is not a problem.
      For example, shared memory regions are not destroyed, and some
      unlike errors don't undo everything that succeed before the error.

@item The shared memory thing has no locking at all, and the sequencing
      engine is pretty simple-minded. The only expected user is a
      real-time process running on a coprocessor with a single client
      feeding it one request at a time.

@item Please don't try going near 1k argument/retval size
(@code{MINIPC_MAX_REPLY}: off-by-1 errors are most likely present (and
I have no tests yet to feel safe).

@item Strings passing may have some hidden bugs.

@item Struct passing may be faulty in some corner cases.
