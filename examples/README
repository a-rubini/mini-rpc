	trivial-server and trivial-client
	---------------------------------

These two were called sample-server and sample-client in earlier
snapshots of the package (when no examples subdirectory existed).

The server exports three functions:

    sum: it receives two integers and returns integer

    gettimeofday: it receives nothing and returns struct timeval

    sqrt: it receives one double and returns one double

The server shows how the minipc_pd structures are built and how the
minipc_f function is implemented.  The first function in the file is a
non-rpc aware function, properly wrapped by the second function.

In this case the main loop of the server is simply calling the
server action, without doing anyting else. It is verbose in its
own looping and declares stderr as logfile for the library.


The client declares the same "struct minipc_pd" as the server (more
serious users should define them in a separate object file so they
would be shared). It simply calls the server functions a few times,
with a 0.5s delay between each call.

You can test it like this from two different terminal sessions:

    ./trivial-server

    for n in $(seq 1 20); do
        ./trivial-client &
	 sleep 0.2
    done
